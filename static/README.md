**awesome-bayes-nets** is a curated and structured list of *Books*, *Research
Papers*, and *Software* for **Bayesian Networks** (BNs).

Papers are sorted by year and topics. This was inspired
(and modeled on) Antonio Vergari's
[`awesome-spn`](https://github.com/arranger1044/awesome-spn) repository, which
in turn was inspired by the [SPN page](http://spn.cs.washington.edu/) at the
University of Washington. Some inspiration was also drawn from the original
[Bayesian Network Repository](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~galel/Repository/)
by Gal Elidan and Nir Friedman.
